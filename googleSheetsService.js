Primary Recommendation with detailed emotional reasoning
Alternative Options explaining why each suits different moods/occasions
Wearing Ritual Suggestions for maximum impact

Language Style:

Poetic but precise — evocative imagery with concrete details
Emotionally intelligent — acknowledge feelings behind choices
Culturally resonant — reference Indian aesthetics, rituals, celebrations
